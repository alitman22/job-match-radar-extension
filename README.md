# Job Match Radar

Open-source Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) for measuring how relevant a page is against your custom weighted keyword model.

It started as a job-search assistant, but the scoring engine is generic enough for any "is this content relevant to my criteria?" workflow.

## Open-Source Status

- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Safe-to-share repo defaults: no personal backup exports, private keys, or package artifacts are committed (`.gitignore`)
- Contribution-friendly structure: popup for fast actions, settings for deep configuration, background/content scripts for scoring pipeline

## Problem It Solves

When you scan large volumes of content, most pages are only partially relevant.

This extension lets you define what "relevant" means with:

- keyword groups and weights
- phrase signals and weights
- score thresholds and grades
- optional LLM-assisted keyword expansion

So instead of guessing, you get a consistent, explainable score.

## Core Capabilities

### Weighted relevance model

- Group-level and keyword-level weights
- Additive weighted scoring
- Custom grade thresholds (`A`, `B`, `C`)

### Signal extraction

- Phrase detection for special intent/situations (visa, relocation, work mode, etc.)
- Tech-term scanning from current page

### Fast UX + deep UX

- Popup: quick actions (`rescan`, `LLM suggest`, quick edits)
- Settings: structured, collapsible configuration sections

### Data lifecycle

- Export backup JSON
- Restore from file picker
- Reset all (with irreversible warning)

### Runtime control

- Active URL allow-patterns (wildcard support)
- Badge mode (`score`, `grade`, `off`)
- Optional top analytics bar

## How Scoring Works

High-level formula:

`keyword_matches * (group_weight + keyword_weight)`

Then:

- aggregate total score
- map score to grade using configurable thresholds
- include phrase-category signals for context

## Architecture Overview

### `manifest.json`

- MV3 setup
- service worker: `background.js`
- popup: `popup.html`
- options page: `options.html`
- content script: `content-script.js`

### `background.js`

Core orchestration and logic:

- data normalization/defaulting
- scoring pipeline
- badge updates
- LLM provider adapters
- URL allow-pattern checks
- sync storage persistence

Main runtime actions:

- `analyzePage`
- `scanTechKeywordsFromActiveTab`
- `llmSuggestKeywords`
- `getPopupState`
- `saveAll`
- `rescoreActiveTab`

### `content-script.js`

- extracts page text context
- updates optional analytics bar
- triggers rescans safely
- handles SPA/stale-context edge cases

### `popup.*`

Quick, in-flow controls while browsing.

### `options.*`

Full management surface with collapsible settings sections.

## Privacy and Data Handling

- User configuration/state is stored in `chrome.storage.sync`
- Exported backup JSON can contain your custom keywords/settings
- Backup files are intentionally ignored in Git (`.gitignore`)
- No API keys are hardcoded in source

## Other Practical Use Cases

Beyond job matching, this extension can be adapted for many relevance workflows:

### Research triage

- Score articles/papers/news pages against your topic taxonomy
- Quickly decide "read now" vs "skip"

### Procurement and vendor screening

- Evaluate product/service pages against required capabilities
- Track compliance, security, or integration terms

### Security and policy review

- Detect expected policy language on third-party docs/pages
- Flag missing or weak mandatory terms

### Learning path curation

- Rank tutorials/courses by your skill goals
- Highlight pages that match your current learning stack

### Content operations and editorial QA

- Check if pages include required brand/SEO/legal terms
- Score draft relevance before publication

### Sales and lead qualification

- Evaluate prospect sites by industry/tech signals
- Prioritize leads matching your ideal profile

### Grant/funding opportunity filtering

- Score calls/RFP pages against your organization capabilities
- Surface opportunities with strongest fit first

### Competitive intelligence

- Track competitor pages/releases for strategic keywords
- Compare relevance patterns over time

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select this project directory

## Packaging

Use Chrome's native pack flow:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Click `Pack extension`
3. Select extension root directory
4. Reuse the same `.pem` across versions

## Notes

- `create.bat` is a legacy scaffold generator, not a pack/build tool.
- Do not run it on this repo unless you intentionally want to regenerate boilerplate.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Unit tests for scoring and normalization
- Optional typed reset confirmation (`type RESET`)
- Rich backup validation and migration assistant
- Optional CSV export for score history

## License

MIT - see `LICENSE`.
